eventual problems:
--------------------

1- get recent suggestion queries
	- first problem display suggestion list in same screen which holds Movies recyclerView, and solved by 
	  set this setVisibility for this View to Gone.
	- Realm Cannot modify managed objects outside of a write transaction, was mistake by me because i was
	  beginTransaction for Realm object in the init of the Realm instance, solved by set beginTransaction
	  after init the Realm object.

2- unit test for rxJava:
	- i have problem to make test path for function which have implementation for rxJava it crashes in
	  "subscribeOn", and "observeOn", and i solve it by impelment Scheduler for "android", and "process"
	  and path them into presenter init, so i can init them for test using TestScheduler and path them to
	  presenter and the test run.
